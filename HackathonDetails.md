# Problem

Many parents, like myself, are battling with bell schedules during this remote learning period. This problem is especially challenging for younger children with schedules that are not consistent each day.  If parents have children of multiple ages who could attend multiple districts, it requires an effort to keep all schedules straight and ensure all their children make their virtual classes.

# Solution

This is where you come in.  We’d like to see a solution that ingest bell schedules and either makes them available as events in Google Calendar or as announced configured bells in Google Assistant. This would require a Hackathon team figuring out how to create an extension for Google Calendar/Google Assistant.  An assumption could be that data is available in a CSV file but also leave room for possible integrations to SIS/LMS in the future. The rest is up to you!

# The Hackathon Process

As you can imagine, time is of the essence since remote learning has already begun. We’re structuring this as a quick, weekend Hackathon, and Rick will manage it. Teams can be made of an individual or up to 3 team members.  Once you decide on your team, submit the Smartsheet Registration form that will include team name and t-shirt sizes no later than Wednesday, October 14th.


The official Hackathon start time is Friday, October 16th at 8 am.

Solutions need to be complete by Monday, October 19th, at 9 am. Please notify Rick that you have a completed solution for judging via email. Teams will present their solutions on Wednesday, October 21st, during a Brown Bag session. Double Line team members will be able to vote for their favorite submissions.  Winners will be decided based on a combination of team votes and leadership selections.  Rick will announce the winners during the October 26th Town Hall.


# The Prizes

Each participant will get a Double Line Hackathon T-shirt. 

The winning solution will receive $500. Should a team win, they will split the cash prize.

Your name will be entered on the DL Hackathon Wall of Fame! (It’ll be a real thing. We promise.)

Good luck and happy hacking!
